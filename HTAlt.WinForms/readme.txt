HTTitleTabs class is same as TitleBarTabs class but it's modified for Korot and includes some fixes and features.
Also, HTTabRenderer doesn't requires images to draw tabs (unlike EasyTabs' BaseTabRenderer which embeds 
tab images to its Resources) and allows to change colors of the tab.

Current Features:

-ListView Control
-Switch Control
-HTForms Form Type
-MsgBox  Dialog
-ProgressBox Dialog
